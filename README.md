# Sentiment-Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Python, employing VADER with a Bag of Words approach and the Roberta Pretrained Model from Huggingface Pipeline. It compares the model outputs of these two techniques, demonstrating the significance of sentiment analysis in language modeling tasks.

This project aims to create a sentiment analysis classifier for Amazon customer reviews. By leveraging NLTK's VADER and Huggingface's Roberta Transformers, we can explore the differences in model outputs between these two packages and compare the results.

Techniques Used
- VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) with a Bag of Words approach
- Roberta Pretrained Model from Huggingface Pipeline

Project Overview
- Data Preparation: Obtain Amazon customer reviews dataset
- Sentiment Analysis with VADER and Bag of Words approach
- Sentiment Analysis with Huggingface's Roberta Pretrained Model
- Comparison of Results: Analyze and compare the outputs of both techniques
- Conclusion: Summarize the findings and discuss potential use cases

This project showcases the power of open source models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and highlights the importance of sentiment analysis in language modeling tasks.
